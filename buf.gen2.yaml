# Stage 2 of generation, because custom tools are using the 1st stage generated code
# For some reason buf starts all the plugin at the same time, so need this 2nd stage.

# WARNING: We should not use remote plugins here - they tend to exhause buf.build rate limits
plugins:
  # We using this tool to generate non-pb data-only structs to safely pass to drivers,
  # otherwise pb structs has internal mutexes which should not be copied and that forces us
  # to pass the structs by reference which is dangerous.
